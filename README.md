This project is to create a tube amplifier chassis that can be compared to a Dumble Steel String Singer s/n #004. I'm sharing these drawings free of charge with hopes to inspire someone to persue a custom chassis for their tube amplifier goal. These drawings can be used as an educational reference, but is also complete enough to fabricate as-is.


| Page | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| 3D-CAD-Design| *.stp and *.ipt files generated by AutoDesk Inventor |
| AutoCAD-Design | Layout and precision design using AutoCAD. *.dwg and *.dxf files |
| Reference-Pictures | *.png screen shots of various portions of the chassis in Inventor |
| Silkscreen-Artwork | *.pdf and *.svg of the front and back artwork |
| Circuit | Schematics and layouts that are SSS #002 based |


### Notes about Fabrication
When finding a sheet metal fabricator for a quote, they will likely want to know:
* Overall dimensions
* The type of metal
* The thickness of the metal
* Radius bend parameters
* Welding assembly and considerations
* Quantity
* Finishing

I use CAMMetals in Connecticut and recommend their work. I can't guarentee they will take you on as a customer but it doesn't hurt to get a quote. http://www.cammmetals.com/

For this project
* 26.5" x 2.75" x 8.5"
* 5052 Aluminum
* .125" Thick
* .125" Radius bends
* Welding considerations is in the "Reference-Pictures" section of this project. The "sides" will be a second part to tack welded in place. No full weld beads required as the tack welding is enough. 
* Price breaks usually are given after quantity of 2x. Anything in the 10x range will give you the best price breaks.
* SSS #004 has a powder coated finish. I used Harbor Freight powder after it was sand blasted for secure adhesion. The powder can be found here: https://www.harborfreight.com/16-oz-powder-coat-paint-matte-black-93306.html

Send along the *.ipt and the *.stp files to the fabricator as well as the Reference-Pictures. Some fabricators also do powder coating and silk screening of the artwork. I recommend 

### Notes about Silk Screening
You will need the following fonts if you want to modify the *.svg artwork. I cannot upload these fonts because some of them are copyright protected but a quick Google search will likely provide you what you need. 

```sh
BD Geminis
sans-serif
Conthrax
Cooper Black
Xolonium
Goudy Text MT
```
If your chassis is powder coated, provide the silk screener the Manage Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS/SDS) so the silk screener knows which ink to use. The safety sheet will identify the contents of the powder coat so the ink will adhere properly to it. 

There is usually a setup fee and with this fee, the silk screener might adjust the artwork so they can align the holes the way they prefer so the artwork is laid down straight. 

### Notes about the Head Cabinet/Shell
I recommend Taylor @ Amplified Nation http://amplifiednation.com/ to get a quote for making the cabinet for this chassis. I've already talked with him and he's excited to meet your goals. 

### Additional Information
Always double check mine, and your work. I am not responsible for any loses as I'm providing this information for free and educational purposes. I am confident these drawings and files will produce an excellent chassis as-is and I have a bit of experience now with designing and outsourcing my own chasiss. Enjoy and good look! Drop me a message if you have any questions or you want to let me know how your chassis went!
